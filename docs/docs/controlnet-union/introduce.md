## ☁️BizyAir Controlnet Union SDXL 1.0

☁️BizyAir Controlnet Union SDXL 1.0 integrates the project [controlnet-union-sdxl-1.0](https://huggingface.co/xinsir/controlnet-union-sdxl-1.0) . With this node, you can generate images using various control types.

In conjunction with the [controlnet preprocessors](../controlnet-preprocessor/introduce.md) already provided by BizyAir, you do not need to prepare models and environments; you can directly perform tasks like image-to-image generation.

Here is an example: converting a photo of a great white shark into a depth map and then drawing a cyberpunk-style submarine. You can find similar examples in the repository under the examples section.
