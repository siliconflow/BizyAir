# Getting Started

## 1. Setting API Key

!!! note
    You can get your API KEY from [SiliconCloud](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/) for free.

For the first use, you need to set your API key. Click the "BizyAir Key" button to launch the key setting page and set the key.

!!! note
    You don't need to set the key every time you start the program. The key is cached in your local browser, and as long as you don't get a pop-up prompt asking you to enter the key, you can continue to use BizyAir Nodes.

## 2. Using BizyAir Nodes

All BizyAir nodes are under the "☁️BizyAir" category.

Here is a simple example of using the Kolors nodes.
