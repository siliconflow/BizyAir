# Getting Started

## 1. Setting API Key

!!! note
    You can get your API KEY from [SiliconCloud](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/) for free.

For the first use, you need to set your API key. Click the "BizyAir Key" button to launch the key setting page and set the key.

!!! note
    You don't need to set the key every time you start the program. The key is cached in your local browser, and as long as you don't get a pop-up prompt asking you to enter the key, you can continue to use BizyAir Nodes.

## 2. Run BizyAir Examples

Click the "☁️BizyAir Workflow Examples" button, select the desired workflow to load, and then click the "Queue Prompt" button to run it.
