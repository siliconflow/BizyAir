BizyAir is a collection of [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) nodes that help you overcome environmental and hardware limitations, allowing you to more easily generate high-quality content with ComfyUI.

BizyAir nodes are capable of operating in conjunction with local nodes. For example, the workflow below shows the use of BizyAir for ChatGLM3 text encoding and VAE decoding, while employing a local KSampler.
