Key Features: \u00b6 do_sample : The do_sample parameter determines whether the model uses a random sampling method to generate the next word, or simply selects the most likely word. do_sample=True : It can increased variety and creativity of generated text. do_sample=False : The next word with the highest probability will be selected, and the content of the article will be conservative. temperature : The temperature parameter affects the shape of the probability distribution when sampling, and thus the variety of generated text. A higher temperature will make the distribution more uniform and increase randomness. A lower temperature makes the distribution sharper, less random, and more inclined to choose words with higher probability. max_tokens : The max_tokens parameter specifies the maximum number of tokens that the model can generate when generating text. The upper limit here is 512. caption_type : Each caption_type corresponds to the default system prompts. Descriptive : Write a descriptive caption for this image in a formal tone. Descriptive (Informal) : Write a descriptive caption for this image in a casual tone. Training Prompt : Write a stable diffusion prompt for this image. MidJourney : Write a MidJourney prompt for this image. Booru tag list : Write a list of Booru tags for this image. Booru-like tag list : Write a list of Booru-like tags for this image. Art Critic : Analyze this image like an art critic would with information about its composition, style, symbolism, the use of color, light, any artistic movement it might belong to, etc. Product Listing : Write a caption for this image as though it were a product listing. Social Media Post : Write a caption for this image as if it were being used for a social media post. caption_length : The caption_length parameter is the length of the output. If the max_tokens parameter is less than it, the output will be truncated. extra_options : If you want to add more prompts to the default prompts, you can write here. For example, if you want to describe the person in the picture as someone, you can write as follow: If there is a person/character in the image you must refer to them as {name}. name_input : The name in the name_input can replace the {name} in the extra_options . For example, you write Jack here and write If there is a person/character in the image you must refer to them as {name}. in the extra_options , it will be found that the person in the image is named as Jack in the output. custom_prompt : If you want to customize the prompts, you can write here to override the prompts and previous actions related to the prompts( caption_type , extra_options and extra_options ) will be invalid.","title":"AI Assistant"},{"location":"ai-assistants/introduce.html#bizyair-siliconcloud-llm-api","text":"The \"\u2601\ufe0fBizyAir SiliconCloud LLM API\" node is a cloud-based AI assistant that provides a set of APIs to help you build conversational interfaces.","title":"\u2601\ufe0fBizyAir SiliconCloud LLM API"},{"location":"ai-assistants/introduce.html#key-features","text":"Dynamic Models List : The node automatically fetches and displays a list of all Large Language Models (LLMs) available in your SiliconCloud account.

A higher value for guidance_scale results in images that more closely follow the input prompt. control_guidance_start and control_guidance_end are values between 0 and 1. They indicate the proportion of the total steps during which ControlNet is applied.
